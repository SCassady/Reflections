What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

An empty git repository is created in the directory. You need to do it to create
a git repository for version control.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is the intermediary space in between the two. The value it has is that you
can decide which files to commit before doing so, and can change your mind about
them and modify before the commit.
