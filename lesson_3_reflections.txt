When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It can act as a backup in the case of a hard drive crash. Also, it can be used to collaborate with different people at different locations.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to review the changes in the remote before bringing them down to your local.
It also might be the case that you don't want to bring the changes down until they are working.
For example, if the build on the remote is broken, you will want to wait until it is ready.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are departures from your master repository, which contain commits which
are not in said master. Clones are copies of other repositories, whether local
or remote. Forks are essentially clones on GitHub. That is, they are a repo which
is simply a copy of a different repo. They are separate from that original repo.
